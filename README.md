# CaptionButtonFixer
Yeah, I can't believe it either. This is definitely the project that I'm the most proud of. Prevent caption buttons from becoming small in fullscreen mode in Windows 10 and 11. The only caveat is that there can be some minor visual glitches in the first few pixels from the top of the program. Also, you will need to use a Windhawk mod to disable programs from extending their frames into client areas to use mspaint, WordPad, and a few other rarely used programs with decent-looking window borders.
